# Kobo Collect (With Image Compression Function)
## Introduction
This project aims at developing an android application for ground response team in order to collect data(on site of disaster). The kobo collect app is an Android app for filling out forms. It is designed to be used in resource-constrained environments with challenges such as unreliable connectivity or power infrastructure. ODK Collect is part of Open Data Kit (ODK), a free and open-source set of tools which help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. Learn more about the Open Data Kit project and its history here and read about example ODK deployments here. It renders forms that are compliant with the ODK XForms standard, a subset of the XForms 1.1 standard with some extensions. The form parsing is done by the JavaRosa library which Collect includes as a dependency.
## This Version
This version is a minor iteration to the original ODK collect application and consists of a bitmap image compression function which stores a low resolution copy of the images taken by the app in the phone memory.
## Usage
This repository consists of the source code for the application and the apk which can be installed on the android device.

**NOTE: The previous version of android application must be uninstalled from phone before installing this APK.**
